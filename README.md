# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arawind

An Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning enthusiast and researcher with a strong passion for solving real world problems through intelligent systems. I thrive at the intersection of innovation, leadership, and hands on development whether it's leading a team through a 24-hour hackathon or designing memory-enabled AI architectures.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve **led multiple teams to victory** in hackathons, building full-stack AI applications from scratch under tight deadlines. These projects often integrated cutting-edge technologies like long-term memory systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal inputs (text, image, voice), enabling natural, context-aware interactions.

My most notable work is the **Long-Term Memory System (LTMS)**, a research-backed architecture that empowers large language models with the ability to retain contextual knowledge across sessions. This system significantly enhances the relevance, personalization, and intelligence of conversational AI.

I constantly strive to bridge the gap between academic research and production-grade systems, pushing technological boundaries while keeping user impact at the core.
