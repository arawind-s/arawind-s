# 👋 Hi, I'm Arawind

An Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning enthusiast and researcher with a strong passion for solving real world problems through intelligent systems. I thrive at the intersection of innovation, leadership, and hands on development whether it's leading a team through a 24-hour hackathon or designing memory-enabled AI architectures that mimic human cognition.

Over the past few years, I’ve **led multiple teams to victory** in hackathons, building full-stack AI applications from scratch under tight deadlines. These projects often integrated cutting-edge technologies like long-term memory systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal inputs (text, image, voice), enabling natural, context-aware interactions.

My most notable work is the **Long-Term Memory System (LTMS)**, a research-backed architecture that empowers large language models with the ability to retain contextual knowledge across sessions. This system significantly enhances the relevance, personalization, and intelligence of conversational AI.

I constantly strive to bridge the gap between academic research and production-grade systems, pushing technological boundaries while keeping user impact at the core.

## 🧠 Long-Term Contextual Memory System (LTMS)

**LTMS** is a pioneering architecture I developed and published, designed to bring long-term, multimodal memory to language models — enabling deeper, more personalized AI conversations.

### 📄 Research Publication
**Title**: *Long-Term Contextual Memory for AI Systems*  
**Journal**: IRJMETS – March 2025 Edition  
**Highlights**:
- 42% improvement in response relevance
- 37% boost in user satisfaction
- Persistent multi-session memory retention
- Multimodal context handling (text, image, voice)
- Lightweight and scalable
